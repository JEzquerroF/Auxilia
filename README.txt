Shooter project - Created by Julieta Alvite, Javier Ezquerro and Jaume Gonzalez

- 2D top-down game
- The objective is to reach the end of the level alive
- The player's movements are attack with left click, pick up with right click (to change weapons or pick up healing), and dash with left shift
- If the player dies, the level restarts
- Each level remembers the player's best time, allowing them to compete for better times

WEAPONS:
- The player starts with a sword, and can pick up other weapons from enemies
- The pistol attacks frequently but doesn't do much damage
- The sword does a fair amount of damage but can only attack up close
- The shotgun shoots a lot of bullets but with a lot of bullet spread
- The bow does a fair amount of damage and goes through enemies, but has a long reload time
- The wand launches a very strong attack, but the bullet has to accelerate when firing
- The machine gun launches a lot of bullets, but with little damage
- The bazooka does a lot of damage in area, but takes time to attack and can damage the user
- The knockback of the bullets increases according to their damage

ENEMIES:
- They chase you and attack you only if they have seen you or if they are shot
- If you are behind them, very far away, or there is an obstacle in between, they do not see you
- Their weapons rotate slowly towards the player
- They attack you only if they are in the range of their weapon or closer (to avoid hitting each other),
they aim at the player and there is no obstacle in between
- They keep different distances depending on the weapon and if the player is less than 3/4 of it, they
move away
- If the player is not far away and there is a wall they try to attack without showing themselves too much, and if it is very
close they will try to "peek" (hide and come out only to shoot)
- They have 1/3 of the player's life, and can damage each other
- Slimes run away instead of attacking, and release healing

EXTRA:
- There are explosive barrels, which damage all entities in an area
- There are fire platforms, which damage all entities that step on them when lit
